If that appeals to you, then I invite you to join me in my world - a world of magic and endless mysteries, a world of unusual love and genuine pleasure.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;">My name is Aleksandra Ray and I love Monarch butterflies. I am an unusual person living in an ordinary world; a diamond floating in a sea of broken glass. Heaven is my home; the wind is my brother. Beauty, grace, and elegance are woven into my body – the body of a real woman. Even my body, however, is not strong enough to contain my ever searching soul. My soul, blood and name are drawn from the mystical Greek peninsula, floating softly in the beautiful Aegean. My very soul is like the sea - turbulent, imposing and beautiful. "The eyes are the window to the soul," said the wise people, and they are absolutely right.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;">Through my eyes you can glimpse my soul - the waves of soft satin, winding like whirlwinds and breaking into rocks of darkness. My body is but an insignificant barrier, unable to truly contain my raging soul that pervades the world around me, transforming it into a place of mysteries, magic, and beauty. In the space around me, even the relentless grip of reality is not adequate. In the whirlwind of my presence, time flows differently, and a moment can seem a whole eternity, and life - just a moment. My passion for life is irrepressible and I spend all my time searching; searching for experiences, intimacy, and memories, searching for meaning and purpose.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;">I am a free spirit with a firey character. Neither time, nor stereotypes, nor generally established order have managed to break my lightness of being. I still enjoy many things that society expects only a child would do. I love to have long walks, to contemplate the sunset, to read books. I often take the camera and wander aimlessly in search of the perfect image around Boston – the meaningful experience. I am a practitioner of yoga, appreciate good humor and never say no to fine Swiss chocolate. I love meeting new people. I love to talk, to debate and to smile. I have a weakness for sensual stockings and cute kittens.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;">I tremendously love, indeed, I crave, art. It is my way of expressing myself, to bring to life with my hands and with my soul creations that bring pleasure to me and to those I love. I am a passionate artist and a professional jeweler. I love to share my art – the paintings I give away to those I love, and the jewelry – I sell. In every piece, I include part of myself, of my soul. I like to “give away” or “share” myself in that fashion, and I derive great pleasure knowing that this gesture makes people happy.</span></p><p>There is so much more you can learn about me.
